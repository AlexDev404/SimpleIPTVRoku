# SimpleIPTVRoku
A Basic Roku channel for watching IPTV on the Roku

This was forked from sudo97 
Added a few more containers to play mp4 mkv etc 

You need to enter developer mode on Roku to sideload the channel a detailed tutorial can be found here

There is a default playlist with a few channels that can be found on the net or you can edit the m3u with your own or your iptv providers.

Please note it will not sort into categories, this is being worked on and will soon be updated to arrange channels into sections and alphabetical order.
